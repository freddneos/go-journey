# Go Learning Path - Projects & ToDo List

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Go, focusing on both monolithic and microservices architecture. Below is a structured path with projects and tasks to complete at each stage. Each project corresponds to a specific set of skills or concepts to learn in Go.

---

## **Phase 1: Go Fundamentals**

### **ToDo List:**
- [ ] **Set Up Environment**
  - [ ] Install Go on MacOS.
  - [ ] Configure VSCode with Go extensions.
- [ ] **Basic Language Features**
  - [ ] Learn core syntax: variables, types, functions, loops, conditionals.
  - [ ] Study slices, arrays, maps, and structs.
  - [ ] Understand Goroutines and channels.
- [ ] **Go Idioms and Best Practices**
  - [ ] Learn Go's error handling approach.
  - [ ] Understand Go Modules for dependency management.
  - [ ] Learn Go testing (unit tests and benchmarks).
  - [ ] Read "Effective Go".

### **Project 1: CLI Tool**
- **Description:** Build a command-line tool that performs basic file operations (e.g., file listing, copying, and deleting). This project will help you learn Go's syntax, file handling, and basic command-line argument parsing.
- **Goals:**
  - [ ] Use Go's standard library for file operations.
  - [ ] Implement concurrency using Goroutines for parallel file processing.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for your CLI tool.

## **Phase 2: Intermediate Go - Monolithic API Development**

### **ToDo List:**
- [ ] **Web Frameworks**
  - [ ] Build simple HTTP servers using `net/http`.
  - [ ] Choose a web framework (Gin, Echo, or Chi).
  - [ ] Implement RESTful principles.
- [ ] **Database Interaction**
  - [ ] Choose an ORM (GORM or SQLX).
  - [ ] Implement database CRUD operations.
  - [ ] Set up database migrations.
- [ ] **Advanced Topics**
  - [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication.
  - [ ] Integrate structured logging with `logrus` or `zap`.
  - [ ] Implement configuration management using `viper` or `envconfig`.

### **Project 2: Simple Blog API**
- **Description:** Build a blog API with user authentication, CRUD operations for posts, and comments. This project will focus on using a Go web framework, database integration, and applying RESTful principles.
- **Goals:**
  - [ ] Implement user authentication with JWT.
  - [ ] Build CRUD endpoints for posts and comments.
  - [ ] Use GORM or SQLX for database interaction.
  - [ ] Add logging and configuration management.

## **Phase 3: Advanced Go - Microservices Architecture**

### **ToDo List:**
- [ ] **Microservices Basics**
  - [ ] Learn inter-service communication using REST and gRPC.
  - [ ] Integrate with message brokers like NATS, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
  - [ ] Set up service discovery with Consul or Kubernetes.
- [ ] **Building Microservices**
  - [ ] Explore Go-Kit or Go-Micro frameworks.
  - [ ] Implement inter-service communication.
  - [ ] Containerize services with Docker.
  - [ ] Deploy microservices on Kubernetes.
- [ ] **Resilience and Observability**
  - [ ] Integrate Prometheus for monitoring.
  - [ ] Use OpenTelemetry or Jaeger for distributed tracing.
  - [ ] Implement circuit breakers and retries using `hystrix-go` or similar libraries.

### **Project 3: E-Commerce Microservices**
- **Description:** Build an e-commerce platform using microservices architecture. This project will involve multiple services (e.g., user service, product service, order service) that communicate with each other.
- **Goals:**
  - [ ] Implement gRPC for service-to-service communication.
  - [ ] Use a message broker for event-driven architecture (e.g., order events).
  - [ ] Deploy the microservices on Kubernetes.
  - [ ] Monitor the system with Prometheus and Grafana.

## **Phase 4: Mastery and Ecosystem Exploration**

### **ToDo List:**
- [ ] **Advanced Concurrency Patterns**
  - [ ] Implement worker pools, pipelines, and fan-in/fan-out patterns.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Profile your applications using `pprof`.
  - [ ] Benchmark critical paths using `testing.Benchmark`.
- [ ] **Security Best Practices**
  - [ ] Secure Go applications (avoid common security pitfalls).
  - [ ] Manage dependencies securely.
- [ ] **Exploring the Ecosystem**
  - [ ] Explore Go tools for code generation (`go generate`).
  - [ ] Contribute to open-source Go projects.

### **Project 4: Real-Time Chat Application**
- **Description:** Build a real-time chat application with WebSockets, focusing on performance and scalability. This project will utilize advanced concurrency, performance optimization, and secure coding practices.
- **Goals:**
  - [ ] Implement WebSocket communication.
  - [ ] Optimize the application for high concurrency.
  - [ ] Secure the application against common vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Contribute enhancements to an open-source Go project.
